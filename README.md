# Elements-of-Micro

This repo will contain materials for weekly discussions on Greg Mankiw's "Principles of Microeconomics." These materials are designed for Johns Hopkins' Fall 2026 Elements of Micro course, taught by professor Muhammad Husain.

The "slides" folder contains the slides for each week's discussion. The "practice problems" folder contains the practice problems we will go over in our discussion section each week; the solutions will also be posted in the "practice problem solutions" folder once we have discussed them. 

These materials are adapted, and sometimes used directly, from @jhyder3's Elements of Microeconomics material, to her I give many thanks.
